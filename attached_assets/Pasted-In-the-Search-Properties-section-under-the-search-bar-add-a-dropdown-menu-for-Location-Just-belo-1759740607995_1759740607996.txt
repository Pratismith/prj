In the Search Properties section under the search bar, add a dropdown menu for “Location”. Just below that, change the existing field labeled “Any” to “Property Type”, which should include options like “Any”, “Apartment”, “House”, “Studio”, “Homestay”, “PG”, and “Villa”. Also, fix the close button in the Search Properties section so that it properly closes the panel when clicked. Next, resolve the price display issue on the homepage — after adding a property through the Add Properties form, the price currently shows incorrectly. Ensure the ₹ symbol appears correctly and that the text “per month” is displayed when applicable (for example, ₹15,000 / month). Implement proper currency formatting using the Indian locale (INR) so prices appear consistent and professional across the site.

Then, go to the View Details page — currently, the images are not displaying properly, and the right-side property details are unstable and misaligned. Make the gallery section stable, responsive, and properly dynamic, ensuring that all images load correctly with proper aspect ratios, placeholders, and lazy-loading enabled. The details section on the right should stay consistently aligned, even when images are loading or when resizing the browser. On larger screens, make the details section sticky on the right while scrolling, and on smaller screens, stack it neatly below the gallery.

Rebuild the My Properties section so that it displays all listed properties neatly in a modern card layout with thumbnails, titles, prices, and management actions (edit, delete, view, etc.). Add a new button called “Add Homestay” under the “My Properties” button. When clicked, it should redirect to a new webpage for Homestays, which will be integrated with the Add Properties system. This new Homestay section should allow property owners to add homestays with fields for photo gallery, description, amenities, and instructions. Include a search bar, filters, and date availability checker on the Homestay page so that clients can search for stays based on their desired dates and locations.

Clients should also be able to book homestays directly via WhatsApp. Add a “Book via WhatsApp” button on each Homestay details page, which opens WhatsApp with a pre-filled message containing the homestay name, selected dates, and property ID (for example: “Hi, I’m interested in booking Sunrise Homestay from 1st Nov to 5th Nov. Please confirm availability.”). Ensure the WhatsApp number is dynamically fetched from the property owner’s information.

Additionally, make sure that the availability management system works correctly — owners should be able to mark dates as available or unavailable from their “My Properties” dashboard. The Homestay search page must show only the properties that are available for the dates a client selects.

Finally, optimize the entire website for performance and responsiveness. Fix any layout instability, ensure consistent spacing, responsive breakpoints, and accessibility (including keyboard navigation). Use lazy-loading for images, cache frequently requested data, and ensure all components re-render efficiently. The overall goal is to make the UI and UX seamless, bug-free, dynamic, and visually consistent across all pages — Search Properties, Homepage, View Details, My Properties, and the new Homestay section.
